```js
.filter(Boolean)
```


### Conditional classNames filter
```js
export const classNames = (...classes) => {
  return classes.filter(Boolean).join(' ');
};

```

The trick here is, we take any number of parameters and spread them into a single array with `...classes`, use `.filter(Boolean)` array method to filter out any falsy values and join with and empty space

#### Usage 
When you want to conditionally add class names, normally we could do it with ternary operator.
```jsx
<div classNames={`${sticky ? 'sticky top-0 left-0 z-30' : 'relative'} px-8 py-4 flex items-center justify-end text-sm gap-4 text-gray-300 bg-gray-900 `} >
...
</div>

```
This this becomes hard to read when you have to check for multiple conditions. We can make it much cleaner
using this utility function 

```jsx
<div classNames={
  className={classNames(
    'px-8 py-4 flex items-center justify-end text-sm gap-4 text-gray-300 bg-gray-900',
    sticky ? 'sticky top-0 left-0 z-30' : 'relative'
  )}
>
...
</div>
```

When working with tailwindcss, it's common that your class names overflows from your screen. You can use the function to break your multiple classes into multiple lines for readibility

```jsx
className={classNames(
  'absolute right-0 mt-2 w-56 origin-top-right divide-y divide-gray-100',
  'rounded-md bg-white shadow-lg ring-1 ring-black ring-opacity-5',
  'focus:outline-none'
)}
```

Here's another use case of a similar version of the function using the array method `.filter(Boolean)`  

Say you want to stringify address that could have null values.

```js
const addresses = [
  {
    street1: '710 20th St N',
    street2: null,
    city: 'Birmingham',
    town: null,
    country: 'United States',
  },
  {
    street1: '320 N Meridian St',
    street2: null,
    city: null,
    town: 'Indianapolis',
    country: 'UK',
  },
];

```

You could easily filter out the null values of the address
```js
addresses.map((address) => Object.values(address).filter(Boolean).join(', ')) 
// ['710 20th St N, Birmingham, United States', '320 N Meridian St, Indianapolis, UK' ]
```
